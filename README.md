So basically this is the README.md file for the West Springfield High School 2019-2020 Robotics Club repository.
We don't actually have any code here, this is just a placeholder.
Also we should probably install FTC Repository and Android Studio. Please use your actual laptop, as these school PCs can't handle those programs due to their 4 GB of RAM, bad screen resolution, and bad processors.
The program will probably also be blocked anyway.
